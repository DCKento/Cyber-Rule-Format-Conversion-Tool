# Cyber Rule Format Conversion Tool
The CRFCT is aimed at facilitating the conversion of detection and threat rules from one format to another, making it easier for cybersecurity professionals to adapt rules for different technologies utilized within their work environment. The CRFCT serves as a bridge among various cybersecurity platforms, facilitating the effortless conversion of detection and threat rules from one format to another.

The CRFCT aims to offer the following benefits for Cybersecurity teams:

<ins>Ease of Adaptation:</ins>
The CRFCT eases the transition of rules across different platforms, making it significantly simpler for practitioners to adopt new technologies or integrate diverse systems within their existing infrastructure. Detection rules or threat syntax shared online for a specific format can also be easily converted for ingestion into the specific tool or platform used within their specific security stack.

<ins>Time and Effort Saving:</ins>
Manual conversion of rules can be time-consuming and error-prone. The CRFCT automates this process, saving valuable time and effort that can be channeled towards more critical cybersecurity tasks.


<ins>Enhanced Accuracy:</ins>
By automating the conversion process, the CRFCT minimizes the risk of human error, ensuring that the translated rules maintain their intended logic and functionality across different platforms.


<ins>Broadened Access to Resources:</ins>
Often, valuable detection and threat rules are shared within the cybersecurity community in a specific format. The RFCT broadens access to these resources by eliminating format compatibility as a barrier.


<ins>Learning and Exploration:</ins>
By observing how rules are translated from one syntax to another, practitioners can deepen their understanding of different rule formats and the underlying logic governing them.


<ins>Increased Collaboration:</ins>
The CRFCT fosters a collaborative environment by enabling seamless sharing and adaptation of rules among different teams, each possibly utilizing different cybersecurity platforms.


<ins>Ease of Experimentation:</ins>
Practitioners can effortlessly test how specific rules perform across different platforms, aiding in the evaluation and comparison of various cybersecurity solutions.


<ins>Complex Conversion Handling:</ins>
For complex conversions where a 1:1 translation isn't possible, the CRFCT provides multiple options and additional insights, assisting users in making informed decisions on how to best adapt the rules. The CRFCT can be used as a starting point even if 1:1 conversion is not possible, and provide further guidance for security teams.


<ins>Prompt Deployment of Threat Mitigation Measures:</ins>
In a rapidly evolving threat landscape, being able to quickly adapt and deploy threat rules across various platforms can significantly enhance an organization's responsiveness to emerging threats.


<ins>Extensibility:</ins>
The design of the CRFCT allows for the easy addition of new rule formats, ensuring the tool remains relevant as new technologies and rule syntaxes emerge in the cybersecurity arena.

## Approach:
The CRFCT tool has a simple web UI where users can paste a rule (or multiple rules) in a text box, select the desired output format from a dropdown menu, and click the 'convert' button to initiate the conversion. The tool will utilize the ChatGPT API, with the GPT-4 model, to perform the rule conversions.

## Usage Instructions:
Open the RFCT web UI.

Paste the rule(s) to be converted in the input text box.

Select the desired output format from the dropdown menu.

Click the 'convert' button.

View the converted rule(s) in the output area, or any error messages if the conversion was unsuccessful.

## Requirements:
Frontend:
A web-based UI with a text box for rule input.
A dropdown menu for selecting the output format.
A 'convert' button to initiate the conversion.
An output area to display the converted rule(s) or any error messages.

Backend:
Python backend to handle requests and interact with the ChatGPT API.
Integration with the ChatGPT API to perform rule conversions.
Dependencies:
OpenAI GPT-4 API for rule conversion.
Any necessary web frameworks and libraries for creating the web UI.


A Flask web application is created with two routes - one for rendering the home page and another for handling the conversion request.
The /convert route receives the user input and selected format from the frontend, prepares the data for the ChatGPT API request, sends the request, extracts the converted rule from the response, and returns it to the frontend.
The frontend (index.html) has the necessary HTML and JavaScript to render the UI, capture user input, send the conversion request to the backend, and display the converted rule or error messages.
